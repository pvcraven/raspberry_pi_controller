Home Assistant Client
---------------------

This is a project I use where I have a multi-function Raspberry Pi that
integrates with Home Assistant.

Major features:

* Read directly from a keyboard/macropad. This module might be useful for
  anyone wanting a pure Python way to read from the keyboard.
* Sends data to HA to trigger automations.
* Read temperature/humidity and send to HA.
* Update LED displays with time/temp/humidity.
